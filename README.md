## Introduction and Motivation
From time to time, I have collected a pile of papers in **finance** and **econometrics** or **something random** written by researchers far more smarter than me. 

However most of them have been kind of ... just sleeping at the deepest folder in my macbook (thinking about a [Razer Blade 15](https://www.razer.com/gb-en/gaming-laptops/razer-blade?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=adwordsukbrandsystemsbladeC1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI7tWW2pH13AIVBp3tCh21KAUhEAAYAiAAEgK3l_D_BwE) as the next desktop, any ideas?).

The thought of reading these literatures one by one came to my head like a shock and the first stage of my impulse function is to share my reading notes here. 
My assumption is that to keep this going, your kind comments are needed **and much appreciated**.

## Literature Selection Rules
Well, probably there isn't a clear criteria about why this or that paper is in my computer. Most of them should be related to topics such as **asset pricing**, **option pricing**, **volatility modelling**, **stochastic process** and **foreign exchange**. There maybe papers from the our business school's seminars, thus they might be talking about **econometrics**, **banking** or **anything**.

'Authors think, therefore they exist.'

## Methodology
I have been told a lot of times,

_'Keep writting, and write more'_. 

A great suggestion that I was too lazy to follow.
Prof. John Cochrane is a role model by sharing his idea in the [blog](https://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/), which I highly recommend. In fact, you can just subscribe his blog, and forget about this amateur one.
