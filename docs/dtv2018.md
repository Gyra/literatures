## Abstract
We find that deviations from the covered interest rate parity condition (CIP) imply large, persistent, and systematic arbitrage opportunities in one of the largest asset markets in the world. Contrary to the common view, these deviations for major currencies are not explained away by credit risk or transaction costs. They are particularly strong for forward contracts that appear on the banks' balance sheets at the end of the quarter, pointing to a causal effect of banking regulation on asset prices. The CIP deviations also appear significantly correlated with other fixed-income spreads and with nominal interest rates.

# Note
Covered interest rate parity (CIP) has been one of the most important principles in international finance, especially for contracts like forwards. We used to agree that if there is an efficient, arbitrage-free market with no credit risk or transactions, CIP should holds. However, it does not after the last financial crisis. This paper brings out this observation that can lead to better insight of the market.

## Identification of CIP bias
The text book CIP is the following

<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?e^{r_f&space;t}&space;=&space;e^{r_d&space;t}&space;\frac{S}{F}" title="e^{r_f t} = e^{r_d t} \frac{S}{F}" />

here I change the notation style from the original paper. For a currency pair CCY1CCY2, which is the number of domestic ccy (CCY2) per foreign ccy (CCY1). It is the FX OTC style that I am more comfortable with. And then the CIP bias is the x in following

<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?e^{r_f&space;t}&space;=&space;e^{(r_d&space;&plus;&space;x)&space;t}&space;\frac{S}{F}" title="e^{r_f t} = e^{(r_d + x) t} \frac{S}{F}" />

Plotting the bias for G10 major currencies versus U.S. dollar, we have the pretty plot

And a market like this, quoting the author:
```
A potential arbitrageur, noticing say a negative Libor CIP basis on the yen/dollar market, 
would need to borrow in U.S. at the dollar Libor rate, invest in yen at the yen Libor rate, 
and enter a forward contract to convert yen back into U.S. dollars at the end of her 
investment period.
```

## Potential explanations
The potential explanations proposed by this research are
1. Banks' balance sheet constrains
2. International imbalances in demand and supply

To test the hypothesis, authors provide the quarter-end dynamics regression to fit the following figure, from where we can see a clear pattern of the quarter-end effect.

## In a nutshell
The importance of this paper is the identification of the systematic derivation of CIP condition. Since FX spot and forward markets are the most liquid ones in the world, this bias implies the exsitence of arbitrage should be more common than expected. This also hints a large research gap to be filled (heiheihei).
