## Abstract
I use a new technique to derive a closed-form solu- tionfor the price of a European call option on an asset with stochastic volatility. The model allows arbitrary correlation between volatility and spot- asset returns. I introduce stochastic interest rates and show how to apply the model to bond options and foreign currency options. Simulations show that correlation between volatility and the spot asset's price is important for explaining return skewness and strike-price biases in the Black- Scholes (1973) model. The solution technique is based on characteristic functions and can be applied to other problems.

# Notes
Chop-chop, It's time to move on. Start with ansering **"Heston model"**, instead of just **"Black-Scholes model"**, when you are asked to name an option pricing model.

Don't get me wrong, BS is still a very important tool in practice, but not as a pricing engine. It is now used as a 'measuring ruler' to transform the option prices quoted by various pricing models into the _implied volatility_ that everyone understand. 
The disadvantage of BS is that it assume a constant volatility. As a result, it is hard to model the stochastic dynamic of volatility and provide a **volatility smile**.  

To deal with this issue, including Heston model, a number of literatures propose models under the category of stochastic volatility model. Here we will focus on the Heston model.

## Model
The drift-diffusion process is
```
dS(t) = mu S dt + sqrt(v(t)) S dz(t)
dv(t) = k(theta - v(t)) dt + sigma sqrt(v(t)) dz(t)
```
Here the variance is a Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process. Then any contigent claims should follow the PDE
